   <description>NChurn is a utility that helps asses the churn level of your files in your repository.  
Churn can help you detect which files are changed the most in their life time. This helps identify potential bug hives, and improper design.  
The best thing to do is to plug NChurn into your build process and store history of each run. Then, you can plot the evolution of your repository's churn.</description>
